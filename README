GSM::Nbit - GSM 7bit and 8bit data encoder and decoder.

Throughout GSM world "special" encodings called 7bit and 8bit are used.
Encoding in 8bit is just plain HEX value and is provided here for completeness
and ease of use, 7bit packs 8bit data into 7bit HEX value by limiting it to the
lower 127 characters - and hence gaining 1 extra char every 8 characters.

That's how you get 160 characters limit on plain text (ASCII + few Greek chars)
messages with only 140 bytes for data.

Since many modules need such encodings in them, those functions are refactored
here. It's released as separate module and not part of some other distribution
exactly for that reason.

I personally needed to use it in few different modules.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Note that you might need to update your Encode.pm module beforehand for tests
to pass since older version had a bug for gsm0338 encode/decode of @ char.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.
